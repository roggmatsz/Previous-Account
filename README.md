I enabled 2-factor authentication on my previous Github account; unfortunately, I forgot to backup my Google Authenticator APK when I clean-installed Lollipop into my phone. So without further ado, voila: http://github.com/roggmatz

On it you'll find 3 repositories and a fork:
- Animal Project: Contains a prototype add developed for Forsyth County, my current employer. Not very fancy at all, just a "learn by making" sort of thing. I'll be forking it into this current account and making it better soon.

- jOSProj: a simulated operating system done for my undergrad operating systems class. It reads a textfile containing a list of dummy processes, the amount of memory and execution time they need, and displays console messages as the operating system executes it. There are instances where it will enter infinite loops, which is totally not cool, so the plan is to also fork it and fix it up.

- Printstagram: My senior capstone project and official foray into android development. A specification was given to the class from a hypothetical company, which we were to create. It could be developed in any platform and in any language, so I chose Android. It is a sort of Point of Sale system for a photo developing shop from which you request a certain amount of photos of certain size and quality. It then returns the total cost, which is a function of the business rules detailed in the specification given. It should be without saying that its pretty bare and that it could be so much more, so again, the plan is to fork it and improve it.

- Xposed-Burnt-Toast: the fork of an android xposed module that displays the app's icon alongside whatever Toasts (a brief form of notification in Android) it makes. I forked it with the intention of reducing the size of the icon. Before I uploaded my commits to the fork, however, my laptop died and with it my code. I haven't touched it since.
